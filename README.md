// Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment: Darcy Rose - try centering your header  and "Our Rooms" without using margins. The paradise section breaks on tablet with overlap but the mobile looks good. The order of the pictures should change within the packages mobile, so that it still goes picture-image-picture-image. and the images in amenities could be shrunk down a bit with mobile. lastly the image in reserve a room underlaps the reserve form. All that said, I know how hard you worked and I am very proud of you! Good job!
